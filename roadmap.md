Below is a detailed step‐by‐step plan for converting the Electron app into a Tauri app with an Angular frontend and a Rust backend. In this plan the Angular part is implemented first (only what’s needed for the UI), and all file I/O, folder–tree logic, clipboard actions, etc., will be done via Rust commands that are exposed to the Angular side via Tauri’s API.

---

## 1. **Prepare the Angular Frontend**

### 1.1. Set Up the Angular Project within the Tauri App

- **a. Create an Angular workspace/application:**  
  If not already done, use the Angular CLI to generate a new Angular project (or add Angular to your existing Tauri project’s frontend folder).
  ```bash
  ng new tauri-file-copy-app --routing=false --style=css
  ```
- **b. Integrate Tailwind CSS:**
  - Install Tailwind CSS and its dependencies in the Angular project.
  - Configure Tailwind (create a `tailwind.config.js` similar to the Electron version, with your dark/light colors, etc.).
  - Include Tailwind’s directives in your global styles (for example, in `src/styles.css` or a dedicated `input.css` file).

### 1.2. Structure the Angular Application to Mirror the Electron UI

- **a. Create Angular Components:**
  - **HeaderComponent:** Contains the “Select Folder,” “Reload Folder,” and “Toggle Prompt Composer” buttons with their icons.
  - **FileTreeComponent:** Displays the directory tree.
  - **PromptComposerComponent:** Contains the two textareas for “Prompt Format” and “File Format” along with the “Copy Prompt” button.
  - **ToastComponent/ToastService:** For showing toast notifications.
- **b. Set Up Routing and Layout:**  
  Since the Electron app was a single-page view, use a single Angular component (e.g., AppComponent) that arranges the Header at the top and then two columns below (File Tree on the left and Prompt Composer on the right).

### 1.3. Recreate the HTML Structure & Tailwind Styling

- **a. Convert the Electron HTML:**
  - Translate the HTML structure from `/src/renderer/index.html` into Angular templates.
  - Replace the static `<img>` elements with Angular bindings if needed (for dynamic icon toggling).
- **b. Copy Tailwind CSS styles:**
  - Either use the existing Tailwind configuration (tailwind.config.js) from the Electron app (with any modifications needed for Angular) or recreate it in your Angular project.

### 1.4. Implement Angular Logic (TypeScript)

- **a. Create an Angular Service (e.g., `TauriService`):**

  - This service will encapsulate calls to Tauri’s Rust commands using the Tauri JavaScript API (`@tauri-apps/api`).
  - Methods should include:
    - `selectFolder()`
    - `getDirectoryStructure(folderPath: string)`
    - `readFile(filePath: string)`
    - `copyToClipboard(text: string)`

- **b. Re-implement Renderer JavaScript Functionality:**
  - For each button or UI event (folder selection, reload, toggle composer, copy prompt, etc.), write corresponding Angular methods.
  - Convert the existing DOM event listeners from `renderer.js` into Angular event bindings (using `(click)` etc.) inside the appropriate components.
- **c. Handle UI State and Data Binding:**

  - Use Angular’s two-way data binding (`[(ngModel)]`) for the textareas (for prompt and file formats).
  - Use Angular’s component communication (inputs/outputs or a shared service) to propagate folder selection, file tree data, and toast notifications.

- **d. Implement the file-tree rendering logic:**

  - In the FileTreeComponent, recursively render folder and file items.
  - Implement checkbox behavior and expand/collapse toggling for folders (using Angular template loops and click handlers).
  - Make sure to bind the icons (chevron-right/chevron-down, folder open/closed, file, copy icon) as per the assets provided.

- **e. Persist Settings:**

  - Use the browser’s `localStorage` (or Angular services) to save/retrieve the file format and prompt format settings automatically (as done in the original code).

- **f. Toast Notifications:**
  - Create a reusable toast component or service to display notifications, similar to the functionality in `renderer.js`.

## 2. **Develop the Rust Backend (Tauri Commands)**

### 2.1. Create Rust Command Functions

In your Tauri Rust source (e.g., in `src-tauri/src/main.rs` or in dedicated modules):

- **a. `select_folder` Command:**

  - Use the Tauri API to open a folder selection dialog.
  - Return the selected folder path (or `None` if canceled).

- **b. `get_directory_structure` Command:**

  - Recursively read the directory tree using Rust’s standard library (e.g., `std::fs`, `std::path`).
  - Mimic the structure of the Electron version: each node should include a `type` (folder or file), `name`, `path`, and (if a folder) a `children` array.
  - Sort folders first then files alphabetically.

- **c. `read_file` Command:**

  - Asynchronously read file contents (using Rust’s async file I/O if needed or blocking code for small files) and return as a string.

- **d. `copy_to_clipboard` Command:**

  - Use a Rust clipboard library (or Tauri’s clipboard API via Rust) to write text to the clipboard.

  > **Tip:** Tauri already provides safe wrappers for dialogs and clipboard operations. Refer to the [Tauri documentation](https://tauri.app/v1/guides/) for examples.

- **e. Define All Commands with the `#[tauri::command]` Macro:**
  - Make sure each function is annotated so it can be invoked from the Angular frontend.

### 2.2. Wire Up Commands in Tauri’s Main

- In your `main.rs`, register all the commands (for example, in the `tauri::Builder::default().invoke_handler(tauri::generate_handler![ ... ])` call).
- Remove any Electron-specific logic (like Node integration) since Tauri will rely on secure command invocation.

### 2.3. Test Each Command Independently

- Write small Rust test routines or use Tauri’s logging to verify that each command works (e.g., selecting a folder, reading a file, etc.) before integrating with Angular.

---

## 3. **Integrate Angular Frontend with Tauri (Rust Backend)**

### 3.1. Update Angular’s Service to Use Tauri’s API

- In your `TauriService`, use the `@tauri-apps/api/tauri` module to call commands (e.g., `invoke('select_folder')`).
- Handle promise responses and error cases.

### 3.2. Replace Electron IPC Calls

- In all Angular components where the original code used `ipcRenderer.invoke`, replace with your service’s methods that call the corresponding Tauri commands.

### 3.3. Asset Paths and Bundling

- Ensure that your Angular build copies the SVG icon assets into the appropriate location so that the Angular components can reference them correctly (update Angular’s `angular.json` assets configuration as needed).

### 3.4. Build & Configure Tauri to Serve Angular

- Configure Tauri to load the Angular built (production) files.
  - Update the Tauri configuration (typically in `tauri.conf.json`) so that the `dist/` folder of your Angular app is used as the web asset directory.
- Test the integration by running the Tauri development server and verifying that Angular calls invoke the Rust commands properly.

---

## 4. **Final Testing and Refinement**

### 4.1. Test UI Interactions

- Verify that clicking “Select Folder” opens the folder dialog (via Tauri’s command) and that the file tree is rendered correctly.
- Test the expand/collapse functionality of folders.
- Check that selecting files (via checkboxes) and clicking “Copy Prompt” correctly reads file contents, formats them using the saved settings, and calls the Rust command to copy the result to the clipboard.
- Ensure that toggling the Prompt Composer works as expected.

### 4.2. Debug and Log

- Use Tauri’s logging (and Angular’s console logs) to trace any errors in command invocation or file I/O.
- Make sure that all error cases (e.g., folder not selected, file reading errors) are handled gracefully in the Angular UI (via toasts or error messages).

### 4.3. Package and Build

- Once the integration is complete and all features are working, build the Angular project for production.
- Rebuild the Tauri application so that it packages the Angular build output along with your Rust backend.

### 4.4. Final Cross-Platform Testing

- Test the final Tauri app on all targeted platforms (Windows, macOS, Linux) to ensure that dialogs, file operations, and clipboard functionality work as expected.

By following these steps, you will have migrated the Electron app’s functionality to a modern Tauri application with Angular handling the UI and Rust taking care of the backend logic.
